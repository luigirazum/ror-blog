# Blog app: add API endpoints

## Learning objectives
- Build an API that is RESTful.
- Understand importance of APIs and docs following standards.

## Description
In this project, you will add some API endpoints to your Blog app. This will allow your app to be used in different ways, rather than just through your site - for example, a mobile app or a CLI application.

### Project requirements

***NOTE:*** _If you transitioned from 1.0 Microverse program use the [Social Media website](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/fast-track-curriculum/69047/path/step/49736080/) you have built._

- Create an API endpoint to list all posts for a user.
- Create an API endpoint to list all comments for a user's post.
- Create an API endpoint to add a comment to a post. Remember that the owner of the comment is the user that makes it; it should **not** be set by passing a parameter.
- Your API endpoints should receive JSON and respond JSON as well.
